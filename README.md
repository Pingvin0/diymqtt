# DIY mqtt-like PHP service
Made with PHP 7.2, MySQL(MariaDB) & PHPMyAdmin

# Setup
Create a database for this and remember the name.
Import the provided .sql file into that database.
**If you plan on having this not in the mqtt directory, you must change the prefix in common_funcs.php**
Create a user within mysql that has access to the database you just created
Change the connection details in common_funcs.php
You're done, if you want you can remove the default user of mine which is Pingvin0

This is a base concept, and will maybe get improved functionality.
